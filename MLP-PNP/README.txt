This folder contains data representing the 9 geometric parameters of a cellular structure and 2 outputs obtained from FEA (stiffness and specific stiffness).
The IPYNB file trains a NN to map the geometric parameters to each output individually.
Subsequently, a Sobol sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the influence of each geometric parameter on the outputs.
